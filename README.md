The Project is a react app using typesscript template.
it uses the below libraries in addition to React Js.

1. React-router-dom for differrent page redirection.
2. React Redux toolkit for maintaining global states which is used at different components to avoid prop drilling.
3. Context API for loader and also for passing the theme to the child components .
4. Styled Components with props which facilititates the dyanmic css properties.
5. Sass preprocessor for mixins and variable.

Note : the screens are not yet optimised for mobile/ tablet screens - it is in progress.
